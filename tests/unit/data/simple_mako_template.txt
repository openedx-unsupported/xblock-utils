This is a simple template example.

This template can make use of the following context variables:
Name: ${name}
List: ${items}

It can also do some fancy things with them:
Default value if name is empty: ${ name or "Default Name"}
Length of the list: ${len(items)}
Items of the list:\
% for item in items:
 ${item}\
% endfor
